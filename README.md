# ROBLOX Building Tools
A set of simple, yet flexible in-game building tools for ROBLOX.

## What's so special about these tools?
Each of the tools is designed to be simple, reliable, and flexible for many use cases. Think of this as a swiss army knife for ROBLOX building.

## What are some powerful features of these tools?
* Manipulating multiple targets at once
* Editing at a fine-grained level
* Selecting targets at different levels
* Dumping creations to log files so that they can be used outside of a game
* Hotkeys to switch between the tools

## How can I get them?
This project is still under development. Check back soon for a release, or watch the repository to get updated on its progress!
