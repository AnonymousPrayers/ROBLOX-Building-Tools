Building Tools by F3X
=========================
A set of powerful, easy building tools for ROBLOX.

## What's included?
BT includes the following tools:
  - A __move__ tool, which lets you move parts normally, each part relative to itself, or relative to the last part selected. You can also change the increment 
  -  A __resize__ tool, which lets you resize parts in either a single direction, or in both directions. You can also change the size increment.
  -  A __rotate__ tool, which lets you rotate parts around the center of the selection, each part around itself, or around the last part selected. You can also change the increment by which to rotate the part.
  -  A __paint__ tool, which lets you change the color of parts.
  -  A __surface__ tool, which lets you change the surface types of parts.
  -  A __material__ tool, which lets you change the transparency, reflectance, and material of parts.
  -  An __anchor__ tool, which lets you make parts anchored (or not).
  -  A __collision__ tool, which lets you enable (or disable) collision on parts.
  -  A __new part__ tool, which lets you create new parts of different shapes and types.
  -  A __mesh__ tool, which lets you add meshes to parts.
  -  A __texture__ tool, which lets you add decals and textures to parts.
  -  A __weld__ tool, which lets you create an artificial weld between parts.
  -  A __lighting__ tool, which lets you add spotlights and point lights to parts.
  -  A __decorate__ tool, which lets you add smoke, fire, and sparkles to parts.

You can also:
  -  Export your creations and import them into Studio (using [this plugin](http://www.roblox.com/item.aspx?id=142485815))
  -  Select multiple parts in various convenient ways such as:
       - Adding parts to the selection individually (shift + click)
       - Selecting parts using a 2D rectangle (shift + click/drag)
       - Selecting parts found within the parts in the current selection (shift + k)
  -  Clone parts
  -  Delete parts
  -  Undo and redo any changes you make
  -  Switch between tools using hotkeys
